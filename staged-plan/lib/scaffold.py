"""Scaffold a staged-plan markdown with all boilerplate blocks pre-rendered.

Usage:
    python scaffold.py --slug <slug> --title "<plan title>" \
        --stage "Stage 1 title" --stage "Stage 2 title" ... \
        --output <repo-root>/<plan-dir>/<slug>.md \
        [--mode autonomous|semi-autonomous] \
        [--working-tree clean-required|stash-authorized|integrate-existing|abort-until-clean] \
        [--reviewer none|light|deep] \
        [--reviewer-reason "<why this level>"] \
        [--report-policy committed|gitignored] \
        [--force]

`--output` may point to ANY path inside a git repo. The canonical convention
is `<repo-root>/docs/plans/<slug>.md`, but harness integrations (e.g.
`backlog-claude-runner`) may direct the plan to a different in-repo dir
(`.agents/tmp/...`, `.agents/plans/...`, etc.). The scaffold derives the
plan directory from `--output` and substitutes it everywhere the boilerplate
references the plan dir — so verify scripts, report templates, and the Plan
landing commit advice stay consistent regardless of the chosen location.

The planner runs this BEFORE filling in stage-specific content. Output contains
all repeated boilerplate (Execution model, Execution policy, Executor adapter,
Reviewer gate, Stage 0, hand-off template, End-to-end verification) so the
planner only edits the cognitive parts: per-stage scope, files, order of
operations, and hand-off prompts.

Safety:
- --output is required (no stdout redirect, which can truncate an existing
  file before Python decides whether to error).
- --output must resolve inside a git repo (or pass --allow-outside-repo for
  the rare no-repo planning fallback).
- If --output already exists, the script aborts with exit 3 unless --force is
  passed. This protects filled plans from being silently overwritten.

EXECUTION_MODEL = """## Execution model (READ FIRST)
Staged subagent execution (prompt chaining + gate checks). Do NOT run as one linear task.

0. **Pre-execution placeholder gate** (mandatory, before launching any stage). Run:
   ```
   python3 -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0,'docs/plans'); from _verify import V; V.assert_no_placeholders('docs/plans/{slug}.md'); sys.exit(V.summarize())"
   ```
   If non-zero, abort and surface the offending lines. Fix or delete the flagged blocks; do NOT bypass.
1. **Parent** reads this plan end-to-end (orchestration needs the full picture).
   **Subagents** read only the sections their hand-off prompt names — never
   other stages' blocks. This split is a deliberate token optimization.
2. Run Stage 0 (Pre-flight). If any gate is red on the baseline, abort.
3. For each Stage N >= 1, launch a fresh subagent (see `## Executor adapter`):
   - prompt: the verbatim Hand-off prompt block for that stage
   - description: the stage title
   - foreground, sequential, `model` selected per Tier/Effort (see `## Executor adapter` mapping table)
4. On return, verify: build + gates clean, commit SHA present in `git log`,
   post-stage report written, scope respected (only declared files touched).
5. Green -> Mode handling:
   - autonomous: launch Stage N+1 immediately.
   - semi-autonomous: post the post-stage summary + `Resume? [y / edit / abort]`
     and wait. `y` -> launch Stage N+1; `edit` -> user adjusts the next
     hand-off then `y`; `abort` -> stop (committed work is preserved).
   Red -> apply the `## Execution policy` retry rule.
6. After the final stage, run `## End-to-end verification`, run the
   `## Reviewer gate` if not `none`, and emit the
   stage -> SHA -> report-path summary table.

Parent responsibilities (not delegable): launching stages in order, verifying
green between stages, running end-to-end verification, running the reviewer
gate if configured, producing the summary.

Resuming after a red stage: each hand-off prompt only assumes prior commits
exist in `git log`, not that they came from subagents. If Stage K was fixed
manually, relaunch Stage K+1 unchanged. Never re-run committed stages.

### Resource selection vocabulary (read before launching each stage)

Each stage declares `Tier:` (cognitive load) and `Effort:` (reasoning budget).
The executor at runtime maps these to the cheapest viable resource on its
platform that meets BOTH dimensions. The plan does NOT name models — that is
the executor's responsibility (it knows its own lineup and pricing).

**Tier:**
- `mechanical` — literal execution of a well-specified hand-off (rename, move,
  apply pattern from list). Smallest model that can follow the instruction.
- `standard` — typical coding within the declared file list, light judgment.
- `judgment` — scope decisions, semantic synthesis, non-obvious refactors.
- `critical` — security, public contract, data migration, irreversible changes.

**Effort:**
- `minimal` — no extended reasoning; cheapest setting.
- `standard` — default reasoning budget.
- `extended` — maximum reasoning budget the executor offers.

**Selection rule:** pick the cheapest model × reasoning combo on your platform
that meets or exceeds the declared Tier and Effort. Do NOT auto-promote on
retry — if a `mechanical` stage fails twice, the classification was wrong;
STOP and replan rather than silently escalating to a bigger model.

**Role defaults** (apply when not overridden by a stage block):
- Parent / orchestrator: `standard / standard`
- Stage 0 (pre-flight gates): `mechanical / minimal`
- Reviewer gate: `critical / extended`
- Stage N >= 1: declared per stage; absence defaults to `standard / standard`
"""

_PLAN_LANDING_COMMIT_HEADER = """## Plan landing commit (mandatory before Phase 2)
Before launching Stage 1, the planner (NOT a subagent) makes a single commit
that lands this plan and its support artifacts. This is plan setup, not
feature work — isolating it here keeps Stage 0 and Stage 1+ scope-clean.

**Pre-check (mandatory):** before staging anything, inspect `<repo>/.gitignore`.
The Plan landing commit assumes `docs/plans/` is **trackable**. Two cases:

- If `.gitignore` ignores `docs/plans/` wholesale (e.g. a `docs/plans/` line),
  **narrow the rule to ignore only logs**: replace that line with
  `docs/plans/logs/`. The plan file, `_verify.py`, and verify scripts MUST be
  versioned; only gate logs are excluded. Do NOT use `git add -f` to bypass —
  the rule itself needs fixing.
- If `.gitignore` does not ignore `docs/plans/`, just append `docs/plans/logs/`
  if not already present.
"""

_REPORT_POLICY_NOTE_GITIGNORED = """
**Report policy: `gitignored`** — this plan was scaffolded with
`--report-policy gitignored`. The Plan landing commit MUST also ensure
`.gitignore` covers report files (e.g. `docs/plans/*-report.md`). If absent,
add the pattern as part of this commit; otherwise post-stage reports will
leave the working tree dirty and fail the `clean-required` policy. Reports
are local-only artifacts; the durable audit trail is the End-to-end summary
table emitted by the parent.
"""

_PLAN_LANDING_COMMIT_BODY = """
The landing commit MUST contain:
1. `<repo>/docs/plans/{slug}.md` — this plan file.
2. `<repo>/docs/plans/_verify.py` — vendored verify primitives; the planner
   copies this from the staged-plan skill source as part of Phase 1.5 if not
   already present in the repo. Stage scripts import it via
   `sys.path.insert(0, 'docs/plans'); from _verify import V`.
3. `<repo>/docs/plans/_report-template.md` — scaffolded alongside the plan;
   subagents copy it as the starting structure for post-stage reports.
4. Any `<repo>/docs/plans/{slug}-verify-stage-N.py` and
   `<repo>/docs/plans/{slug}-verify-e2e.py` scripts the plan declares.
5. `<repo>/.gitignore` with the narrowed/added rule from the pre-check above
   (plus the report-ignoring pattern when report-policy = `gitignored`).

Suggested subject:
`chore(plans): land {slug} staged plan + verify scripts`

After this commit, working tree is clean and Phase 2 starts.

## Logs policy
Gate execution logs are written to `<repo>/docs/plans/logs/<prefix>-<ts>.log`
on every `run_gate()` call. They are **local evidence artifacts, not
versioned**: `docs/plans/logs/` is gitignored via the Plan landing commit.
{report_logs_note}

## Executor adapter

Each stage runs in a fresh context window via whatever delegated-agent
mechanism the executor provides (Claude Code: `Agent` tool with
`subagent_type: general-purpose`, foreground, sequential; Codex / others: the
equivalent fresh-window mechanism, or inline in a clean session if no delegate
mechanism exists).

**Model & effort selection:** the plan declares `Tier:` and `Effort:` per stage
(see `## Execution model` § Resource selection vocabulary). The executor maps
those to its own model lineup, picking the cheapest viable combo. The plan
itself names no model — only the executor knows what's available and what it
costs.

**Mapping for Claude Code** (pass as `model` argument to the `Agent` tool):

| Tier / Effort | `model` |
|---|---|
| mechanical / minimal | `haiku` |
| mechanical / standard | `haiku` |
| standard / minimal | `sonnet` |
| standard / standard | `sonnet` |
| standard / extended | `sonnet` or `opus` |
| judgment / standard | `opus` |
| judgment / extended | `opus` |
| critical / * | `opus` |

Do NOT omit `model` (omission inherits the parent's model and defeats the
cost-tiering — every stage would silently run on the parent's model). For
Codex / other executors, apply the same vocabulary against their lineup.

Roles when no stage-level override is present:
- Parent / orchestrator: `standard / standard`
- Stage 0: `mechanical / minimal`
- Reviewer gate: `critical / extended`
- Stage N >= 1: as declared; default `standard / standard`

"""

STAGE_0 = """## Stage 0 - Pre-flight (mandatory, no feature work, no commit, no versioned report)
**Tier:** mechanical
**Effort:** minimal
Purpose: record baseline state and apply the working-tree policy so later
failures cannot be blamed on prior repo state. Plan support artifacts
(`_verify.py`, verify scripts, the plan file) are already committed via the
Plan landing commit before Phase 2 began.

**No versioned report:** Stage 0 must NOT write `{slug}-stage-0-report.md`
under `docs/plans/` — that would leave the working tree dirty and conflict
with `clean-required`. Baseline evidence goes to the gitignored logs dir;
the human-readable summary is returned to the parent.

1. Capture `git status` and the current HEAD SHA. Write them to
   `<repo>/docs/plans/logs/{slug}-stage-0-baseline.log` (gitignored) and
   return the same summary to the parent.
2. Apply the working-tree policy from `## Execution policy`:
   - clean-required: tree must be clean; if not, abort.
   - stash-authorized: `git stash push -u -m "staged-plan-{slug}-pre"`; record stash ref in the log + parent summary.
   - integrate-existing: leave changes in place; list them in the log + parent summary.
   - abort-until-clean: abort the plan; user resolves manually.
3. Run every gate (build, lint, tests, etc.) on the resulting baseline.
   `run_gate()` already writes its own per-command log under `docs/plans/logs/`.
4. Red -> abort. Green -> working tree must still be clean (or match the
   integrate-existing manifest); proceed to Stage 1.
"""

REVIEWER_GATE = """## Reviewer gate (only if Reviewer != none)
**Tier:** critical
**Effort:** extended
After the final stage commits green:
- reviewer: light -> small subagent validates scope, diff vs. plan, gate
  results, post-stage reports, and obvious risk. Does NOT replan.
- reviewer: deep -> same plus security/perf/maintainability lens for
  stack-relevant best practices.

Reviewer returns a verdict in
`pass | pass-with-notes | fail | blocked`
plus a findings list (each: `file:line`, severity, description).
Reviewer never edits code and never replans.
If a `reviewer` skill is available in the executor, prefer it; otherwise use
an inline QA prompt that takes the plan + diff range as input.

### Arbiter (run only if findings list is non-empty)
**Tier:** critical / **Effort:** focused
Reads the reviewer verdict + findings + diff range. For each finding,
applies this decision tree verbatim:

1. Is this a real defect? (correctness, security, contract, data integrity)
   - No  -> classify `nice-to-have`.
   - Yes -> step 2.
2. Is the fix mechanical (one obvious right answer, no design choice)
   AND fully inside the plan's declared file list?
   - Yes -> classify `must-fix`.
   - No  -> classify `human-judgment`.

Arbiter records both answers per finding in the output md (auditable).
Arbiter does NOT edit code and does NOT replan.

### Fix round (run only if any `must-fix` exists; HARD MAX = 1 round)
**Tier:** standard / **Effort:** focused
Fix-subagent receives only the `must-fix` items + their target files.
- Applies fixes within those files only.
- For each item: writes a `fix note` -- what changed, line(s), and one
  sentence linking the change to the original finding.
- If a `must-fix` proves to require out-of-scope work or a design choice,
  reclassify it as `human-judgment` and skip it. Do NOT block sibling fixes.
After the round: re-run every declared gate (build/lint/test/etc.). Gate
failure does NOT trigger another fix round -- the failure goes into the
pending list and the verdict degrades.

### Re-review (conditional)
Run a second reviewer pass (same level: light/deep) only if EITHER:
- The plan's Tier was `critical`, OR
- The fix round modified files outside the declared scope of the
  originating `must-fix` finding (scope-creep signal).

Any *new* finding from re-review goes straight to the pending list of the
next sequence file. Re-review does NOT trigger another fix round.

### Output file (always written when this gate runs)
Path: `docs/plans/reports/<plan-slug>_reviewer_<seq>.md`
- `<seq>` is a zero-padded 3-digit counter starting at `001`, incremented
  for each run of this gate against the same plan.
- Each sequence file is **immutable** once written. Re-runs produce a
  new file, never overwrite.

Top of file: final verdict in
`pass | pass-with-notes | pass-with-fixes | pass-with-pending | fail | blocked`

Body sections (in order):
- `## Reviewer verdict` -- raw reviewer output, verbatim.
- `## Arbiter classification` -- table per finding: `file:line`, severity,
  class (must-fix / nice-to-have / human-judgment), decision-tree answers
  (defect? yes/no -- mechanical+in-scope? yes/no), 1-line reason.
- `## Fixes applied` -- one entry per `must-fix` corrected, with the fix
  note (what changed, lines, link to finding).
- `## Pending` -- every `human-judgment` finding + every `must-fix`
  reclassified to `human-judgment` during the fix round + any new finding
  from re-review. Each entry:
  - `file:line`
  - reviewer's original finding (short quote)
  - arbiter's reason for human classification
  - suggested action (may be "decide whether to address")

Verdict mapping:
- `pass` / `pass-with-notes` -- reviewer's original verdict, no findings
  needed fixing.
- `pass-with-fixes` -- all `must-fix` corrected, no pending items.
- `pass-with-pending` -- corrections completed (or none needed), but
  `Pending` section is non-empty.
- `fail` / `blocked` -- reviewer's verdict was `fail`/`blocked`, OR gates
  failed after the fix round. Parent stops the plan and surfaces the md
  file path to the user.
